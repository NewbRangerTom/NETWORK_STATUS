This project is designed to monitor the status of your network.
In my region we have a lot of network outages during the storm season storm
I make this so I would have a visual status indicator of my network.

Headers used:
ESP8266WiFi
ESP8266Ping
Arduino

Hardware:
1. ESP8266 Wemos D1 Mini (or Pro depending on what I have on hand)
2. Two dual color (green/red) LED's
   (I used two for some of my holiday decorations but you can more or less)
3. One 10K ohm resistor (you can change this based on your brighness preferences)
4. appropriate lengths of wire for your enclosure of choice
   (I also color coordinated my wire for the LED for ease of identifying)
5. Shrink tube to insulate the LEDs annode's and cathode
6. Male header pins for the LEDs
7. Female headers for the D1 Mini

Wetware:
1. Some imagination for an enclosure and routing of your power source.
   (my first one was made to fit inside a 4 inch (10cm ish) diameter halloween decoration)

Have fun with this little project.
